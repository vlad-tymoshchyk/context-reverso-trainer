# Description
Context-reverso-trainer is a console script which allows you to do universal exercieses on the site of context.reverso.com.
Under 'universal exericises' I mean translating little snippets of text with following comparison with right translation.
Such exercise is actualy an active use of language and will help you to learn foreign language more effectively.

# Todo list

* [ ] Set up websocket connection for easier development
* [ ] Set up a folder with scripts for loading into browser (TamperMonkey script should be also here, and all the TamperMonkey real script should do is to just load github script and append to body)
